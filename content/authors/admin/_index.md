I am postdoctoral fellow in H. Joseph Yost's lab at the University of Utah. I am interested in all things non-coding RNA, especially in relation to RNA regulatory events that are found to be aberrant in Congenital Heart Disease. I am working on characterizing roles for miRNAs in heart development in general and in specific cell types, such as neural-crest derived cardiomyocytes, using various zebrafish transgenic models.
